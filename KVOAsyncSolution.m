To prevent the infinite loop or race condition, ensure that the asynchronous operation within the custom setter is properly managed.  One effective approach is to use a flag to prevent recursive calls or perform all updates within the completion block of the asynchronous operation.

```objectivec
// Corrected implementation in KVOAsyncSolution.m
@implementation MyClass

- (void)setMyValue:(NSString *)newValue {
    if (newValue == _myValue) return; //avoid redundant operations
    _isUpdating = YES; // Set a flag to indicate an update in progress
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
        // Perform the asynchronous operation
        // ...
        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
            _myValue = newValue; 
            _isUpdating = NO; //Clear the flag
            [self willChangeValueForKey:@"myValue"];
            [self didChangeValueForKey:@"myValue"];
        });
    });
}

@end
```
This ensures that the `willChangeValueForKey` and `didChangeValueForKey` methods are called only after the asynchronous operation is complete, preventing any recursive KVO triggering.
