In Objective-C, a rare but perplexing issue can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and custom setters. If a custom setter performs asynchronous operations or triggers other KVO-dependent changes, it can lead to unexpected behavior, such as infinite loops or race conditions. This is because the initial KVO notification might trigger the setter, which might in turn trigger another KVO notification, creating a cascading effect.
